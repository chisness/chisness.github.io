Spinning Up is a great resource by Open AI for Deep Reinforcement Learning. One of the suggestions they have is to code some of the core algorithms from scratch. 

Spinning Up is available here: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html

This blog post "A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning" is another useful resource that explains many of the algorithms here: https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html#q-learning-off-policy-td-control

Since many resources already exist, I plan to mostly just use this as a place to link to the code that I've written, but will also mention any useful points that I come across. 

## Tabular Q 

### Double Q

### SARSA 

## DQN

### Rainbow

## VPG
Possibly more efficient to represent policy
e.g. value hard to calculate, but know if ball going here then go there
don't need max (pushes majorly in that direction)

## A2C

## PPO

## TRPO

## Inverse RL
