I arrived at Sangha Lodge, adjacent to the Sangha-Dzangha National Park, in mid-December. The trails and nature right at the lodge are beautiful, with lots of opportunities to see birds and other small animals. The main attraction of the park is the Dzanga Bai (bai is the local language word for forest clearing, which is saline in French, I think), which is a forest clearing that up to 100 or so elephants congregate at every day. This one is particularly special because there are many minerals in the ground for the elephants to drink. Other animals also show up like buffalo and bongo. Visiting there is fantastic and I believe that it might actually be the best place in the world. 

I had visited Dzanga Bai for two day trips in 2014 during my last visit and was planning to do one overnight visit during this trip, where I'd bring a tent and sleep on the platform. The thing about Dzanga Bai is that it's too easy. You show up and walk up the stairs to the wooden viewing platform and instantly see this amazing scene. Other than a bit of an ant infestation and being a bit overwhelmed from a photographic sense, this is bliss. 

There are in fact quite a few bais in addition to Dzanga Bai. The national park offers a "bai walk" as an activity. It wasn't exactly clear to me what this means, but I was imagining getting to Bai 1, seeing elephants, walking to Bai 2, seeing elephants, and then leaving. The park was technically closed while I was there due to COVID, so I still don't know exactly what this activity entails. 

Sangha Lodge has its own concession adjacent to the park and so it was decided that some kind of forest walking activity would happen. Since I've somehow over the past years become an avid walker/hiker and my favorite kinds of walks are those with fun things that can happen 

There is absolutely no official route or plan and my usual travel planning go-to of Google Maps was useless here.

I decided to do a 3 day/2 night "bai walk". I thought that this meant I'd somehow get to one 

We decided that a 3 day/2 night walk would work well, though one extra day may be best in retrospect. We would drive from the lodge about 30km to the "Libwe" road and from there walk back over the next 3 days mostly through the forest and then through a road parallel to Libwe, while trying to visit a bunch of bais and see as much wildlife as we could. 

We decided that I'd go with Armand, one of the senior staff at the lodge, and three Ba'aka people -- Bosco, Lundi, and Congondele. I think we technically could have done this with only 1-2 people, but having more meant once we got to a campsite we could look in different directions for signs of elephants and other animals.

Two days before leaving, we made a list of all the expenses and food.

I love this kind of traveling/pricing because 

On Monday morning February 9th it was time to go! The five of us going on the trip would travel in the pick-up truck. Two others would join for getting us to the dropoff point: Emy as the pick-up driver and Yaf as the "when a tree has fallen in the road I will fix it" specialist, who would take a motorbike and ride in front of us. 

I was a little unsure of what to expect and therefore also of what to carry. Gear was pretty easy -- tent, sleeping bag, camping mattress, water (note: bring a filter so you don't have to use bottles), and food. I've gotten a bit into trying to pack super light, which would mean things like having a maximum of 2 underwear, 2 socks, 2 shirts even for a very long trip, but the thing is this area is super humid and muddy and so . 

As for camera lenses, I was deciding between a 24-70mm, 70-200mm, or both. I went with a 70-200 to be sure I'd be capable of reaching birds and elephants from far away, and figured I'd use my iPhone for shorter range stuff. The majority of photos did end up being shorter range, but having the long lens was super useful. 

Due to some slight delays (me procrasta-packing), we started leaving at around 7:30am. There was a small mechanical issue with the car that got fixed pretty quickly and then we drove the 3km on the Sangha Lodge road and another couple km to get to Bobongo to stop off at Armand's house to pick up the food that he had bought the day before and to see his large family. 

From there we proceeded at about 8:30am a bit more on the main road and then turned off onto the Libwe road, which is not the best or best maintained road. At 8:45am we ran into a bit of a roadblock. 

By about 10:15am we finally got to our drop-off point. It was there that I realized that only Armand and Congondele had brought backpacks and Congondele's looked like the kind of bag you'd bring to ensure you didn't get charged on a Spirit Airlines flight, not a bag to carry lots of gear in the forest! 

It turns out that the Ba'aka people are insanely resourceful when it comes to the forest and so Bosco was already working on building his own backpack out of forest vines and such. Lundi was making more of a wrap thing to attach a few bags together. 

Once these were ready, we finally got started on our walk. There are some trails in the forest here, but they're kind of for elephants and mostly pretty rough. The Ba'aka walked in front with machetes and would chop off some obstructions, but it's very tough to avoid tripping and getting scratched. It's basically walking on level hard. It is generally flat, so there aren't major issues with getting out of breath, it's just literally hard to walk.
