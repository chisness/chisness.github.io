I've been to about **70/196** countries. My favorite trips have been:

**2014 Republic of Congo and CAR:** CAR has the best elephant viewing in the world and is always an adventure

**2015 Rwanda and DRC:** A loop around Lake Kivu including Virunga, Idjwi Island, Kahuzi-Biega, Nyungwe, Volcanoes, and some hiking/cycling along the lake on the Rwanda side

**2016 Tour d'Afrique:** 4-month bike ride from Cairo to Cape Town

**2016 Gabon:** Awesome elephant viewing including elephants near the beach

**2017 USA/Canada roadtrip:** 2.5 months in a loop from Chicago to the south to California, up to Canada, down to Utah/Colorado, then back to Chicago

**2017 The Israel Trail:** 1.5 months hiking through the whole country from north to south 

**2018 India and Nepal:** India is a crazy place and Nepal is beautiful -- I hiked the Annapurna Circuit

**2018 Living in Paris for 2 months:** J'ai habité à Belleville et j'ai essayé d'apprendre le français (which didn't go that well because I had to Google Translate this)

**2021 Living at Sangha Lodge in CAR for 2 months:** An interesting alternative to living in a city during a pandemic
