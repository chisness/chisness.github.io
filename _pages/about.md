## Non-technical interests
- **Poker:** I played professionally almost entirely online from 2008-2013 and 2020 quarantine has gotten me more excited about playing in the future
- **Photography:** I will eventually post photos on this website
- **Hiking:** I've done a few long hikes in Israel -- the Golan Trail, Sovev Machtesh Ramon, and the Israel Trail
- **Cycling:** I participated in the 2016 Tour d'Afrique ride from Cairo to Cape Town
- **Languages:** Working on Hebrew, French, and Arabic. Native English gradually degrading as I study the others. 
- **Effective Altruism:** I think it's valuable to give to highly effective charities like [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.com) so have committed to giving at least 10% per year through the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.
