## Non-technical interests
- Poker: I played professionally almost entirely online from 2008-2013 and 2020 quarantine has gotten me more excited about playing in the future
- Photography: I will eventually post photos on this website
- Hiking: I've done a few long hikes in Israel -- the Golan Trail, Sovev Machtesh Ramon, and the Israel Trail
- Cycling: I participated in the 2016 Tour d'Afrique ride from Cairo to Cape Town
- Languages: Working on Hebrew, French, and Arabic. Native English gradually degrading as I study the others. 
- Effective Altruism: I think it's valuable to give to highly effective charities like [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.com) so have committed to giving at least 10% per year through the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.
