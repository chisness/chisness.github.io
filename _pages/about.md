I enjoy splitting things into technical and non-technical categories.

## Technical Interests
- General: AI and machine learning, especially reinforcement learning
- AI Safety
- Gambling applications
- I wrote my MSc thesis on [Counterfactual Regret Minimization and Abstraction Analysis in Computer Poker](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcgszjng6u5gj0b/MaxChiswickCFRThesis.pdf?dl=0) (finished at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in 2017). 

## Non-technical Interests
- I enjoy hiking and cycling, which has recently involved lots of Citibiking and dodging tourists on the Brooklyn Bridge and some hiking in Israel
- I like studying languages, but am currently only at a strong conversational level in Hebrew (even after spending 4 years studying Spanish and 2 months in France). I hope to spend time on French, Spanish, and Arabic in the future. 
- DYEL? I used to a lot more, but try to keep it up.
