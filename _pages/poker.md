## Background
I played poker professionally online after graduating from college in 2008 until 2013. I played almost entirely mid-stakes No Limit Texas Hold'em cash games, mostly on PokerStars and totaled playing in the range of 10 million hands. In December 2009, I played 990k hands, which I believe to be the most ever played in a month outside of micro-stakes (lowest stakes were $1-2 NLHE). 

I loved it because 
games were good
freedom
responsibility

### What's the worst part about playing poker?
There is an element of luck in the game and downswings can be very tough because they make you question if you know what you're doing and can sometimes last quite a while.
