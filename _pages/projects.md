## AI Poker
<!-- (This section is repeated on the [Poker](https://chisness.github.io/poker/) page) -->

### [AI Poker Tutorial](https://www.aipokertutorial.com)
Over the years, poker strategy has become more and more mathematical and many top players play by studying game theory optimal (GTO) strategy with "solver" software. This tutorial touches on how the math and algorithms behind the solvers work as well as important poker research papers and ideas. 
- In progress

### Jun 2019: [Most Important Fundamental Rule of Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09895)
Using techniques from machine learning we have uncovered a new simple, fundamental rule of poker strategy that leads to a significant improvement in performance over the best prior rule and can also easily be applied by human players.

### May 2017: [Counterfactual Regret Minimization and Abstraction Analysis in Computer Poker](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcgszjng6u5gj0b/MaxChiswickCFRThesis.pdf?dl=0)
MSc thesis analyzing card abstraction in Kuhn (1-card) poker and betting abstraction in No Limit Royal Hold'em (same as No Limit Texas Hold'em, but with a 20-card deck with cards Ten and higher only).
- Technion Israel Institute of Technology with Professor Nahum Shimkin

## Gambling Applications

## AI Safety
### Sep 2020: Assessing Generalization in Reward Learning
- [Part 1: Intro and Background](https://medium.com/@chisness/assessing-generalization-in-reward-learning-intro-and-background-da6c99d9e48)
- [Part 2: Implementations and Experiments](https://towardsdatascience.com/assessing-generalization-in-reward-learning-implementations-and-experiments-de02e1d08c0e)
- One of the primary goals in machine learning is to create algorithms and architectures that demonstrate good generalization ability to samples outside of the training set. In reinforcement learning, however, the same environments are often used for both training and testing, which may lead to significant overfitting. We build on previous work in reward learning and model generalization to evaluate reward learning on random, procedurally generated environments. 
- Work as part of the 2020 AI Safety Camp with Anton Makiievskyi and Liang Zhou
